# SaveX: An SM64 PC Port save file manager

Have you ever needed more save slots while playing SM64? Well, wonder no more, with an upcoming Bash utility that manages renaming save files to change which saves are loaded and which ones are not.

## How it will be utilized
The tool is planned to save certain, typical 4-slot save files into the program, where you can load a specific file as a way to load even more slots.

The program would go like this:

### SAVING:

User runs program

Program welcomes you; gives you options to load or save slots

User picks to save a save file to a slot

Program asks you to input a file path to save to a slot

User inputs a path and saves to slot 1

(Rinse and repeat for how many 4-slot saves you want to have avaliable)

### LOADING:

User wants to load slot 1

Program loads slot 1 by renaming the save file appropriately so that when the game is run, that very save gets loaded; affectively giving you more save slots

(If you need to load another save with other saves inside the 4 slots, rinse and repeat)
